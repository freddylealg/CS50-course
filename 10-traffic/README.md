I found that by adding more layers to my network, 
the accuracy increased but the time to train too. 
I think the time training on models this size 
does not represent a big problem. 
But more questions appear doing this exercise.

What is the perfect relation between size and accuracy? 

How do we know when we are overfitting?

These answers will arrive with the experience, maybe.
